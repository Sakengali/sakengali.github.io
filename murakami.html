        This page is a collection of excerpts from Haruki Murakami's books that feature cooking. This is analogous to "Bread and Salt" of Mishka in Gentlemen in Moscow. While for Michail Fyodorovych it was a matter of personal pain, for me it's just a random desire. The world just seems a better place with this collection in it.
        <br><br>
        I know it's empty now. I've created this page so that I won't forget about this endeavour.
